        "You now know how to partition data columns, impute missing variables, and load pandas data into tensors. In Section 5.7, you will pick up some more data processing skills. While this crash course kept things simple, data processing can get hairy. For example, rather than arriving in a single CSV file, our dataset might be spread across multiple files extracted from a relational database. For instance, in an e-commerce application, customer addresses might live in one table and purchase data in another. Moreover, practitioners face myriad data types beyond categorical and numeric. Other data types include text strings, images, audio data, and point clouds. Oftentimes, advanced tools and efficient algorithms are required to prevent data processing from becoming the biggest bottleneck in the machine learning pipeline. These problems will arise when we get to computer vision and natural language processing. Finally, we must pay attention to data quality. Real-world datasets are often plagued by outliers, faulty measurements from sensors, and recording errors, which must be addressed before feeding the data into any model. Data visualization tools such as seaborn, Bokeh, or matplotlib can help you to manually inspect the data and develop intuitions about what problems you may need to address."
